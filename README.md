# Prompt Collection
My personal collection of prompts that I use. Some are copied from other devs or collections, some are developed by me. The markdown docs are written in a markdown dialect that is like obsidian markdown. In VS Code you can use foam.foam-vscode to render them properly.

## Contents
- [[workflows]] - the collection of prompts that are actually workflows for complex tasks. Some of them make sense as workflows or commands in AI coding tools.
- [[rules]] - collection of rules for AI coding tools
- [[inbox]] - An inbox of interesting prompts I found, but did not eveluate or qadopt them. Stored for future exploration.
