1. Check if filesystem access is available
2. Create the PRD file in the allowed directory
3. Example usage:
   
   // After creating the PRD content
   I'll save this PRD to your filesystem for easy reference.
   
   <function_calls>
   <invoke name="write_file">
   <parameter name="path">/allowed/directory/PRD-[ProjectName]-[Date].md</parameter>
   <parameter name="content">[PRD content]</parameter>
   </invoke>
   </function_calls>
   
   Your PRD has been saved to: /allowed/directory/PRD-[ProjectName]-[Date].md

If filesystem tool is unavailable:
- Provide the complete PRD in the chat
